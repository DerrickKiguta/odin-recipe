            <h2>The Perfect Ham</h2>
                <p> Slow cooking a whole ham creates a super-moist, wonderfully tender ham. It's also a great 
                    method when you're feeding a huge holiday crowd: pop a turkey in the oven and a ham in the
                    slow cooker, and you're set.</p>  
                <p>This 5-star recipe for Slow Cooker Ham calls for a respectable 8-pound bone-in picnic ham.
                    Other cooks have had success with a 9-pound spiral-cut honey-cured ham.</p>
                    <h4>Ingridients</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>2 cups packed brown sugar</li>
                            <li>1 (8-pound) cured, bone-in picnic ham (not smoked)</li>
                        </ul>
                    <h4>Procedure</h4>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Spread 1 1/2 cups of brown sugar on the bottom of the slow cooker crock. </li>
                            <li>Place the ham flat side down in the slow (you may have to trim it a little to make it fit). </li>
                            <li>Rub the remaining brown sugar over the ham.</li>
                            <li>Cover and cook on Low for 8 hours, or 4 hours for spiral-cut ham. </li>
                        </ol>
