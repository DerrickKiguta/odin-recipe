            <h2>Mexican Wedding Cookies</h2>
                <p>Beyond traditional snickerdoodles and gingerbread snaps, Mexican wedding cookies may come to mind when brainstorming 
                    recipes for a holiday cookie swap. Though the name may imply otherwise, Mexican wedding cookies are made for occasions other than 
                    celebrating matrimony. During Christmastime,you’ll likely find some variation of these powdered sugar-dusted, crunchy, nut-filled 
                    cookies among an assortment of holiday treats.</p> 
                <p>Also referred to as Mexican wedding cakes, these buttery cookies originated outside of Mexico.
                     Their creation has been traced back to medieval Arab baking that predominantly featured ingredients 
                    like butter, sugar, spices and nuts. As trade routes began to broaden, these sweet confections 
                    made their way from the Middle East to all parts of Europe.</p>
